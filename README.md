# Football Stadium Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow and Azure Data Factory

This project automates the process of collecting, cleaning, and processing data about football stadiums from Wikipedia. The pipeline is built using Apache Airflow to orchestrate tasks, and the data is stored and processed in Azure Data Lake, enabling further analytics and reporting through tools such as Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI.
